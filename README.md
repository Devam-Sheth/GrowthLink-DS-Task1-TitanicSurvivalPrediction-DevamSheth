# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project is a solution to the **Titanic Survival Prediction Task** for the GrowthLink Data Science Internship.

## 🎯 Objective

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques on the provided dataset.

## 🧠 Approach

- Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary columns and filled missing values.
- Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`) and normalized numeric features (`Age`, `Fare`).
- Model: Random Forest Classifier with performance evaluated using accuracy and classification report.

## 📁 Dataset

Dataset used: [Kaggle Titanic Test Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file)  
Also included in the `data/` directory.
